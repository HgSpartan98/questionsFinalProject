What famous tragedy may have been caused by the following: a ship moving through a \n thermal inversion, which is layers of cold air below layers of colder \n air, causes extremely high air pressure, which prevents fog from forming. \n The thermal inversion refracts light abnormally and can cause a superior mirage, \n where objects appear higher and closer than they are in reality. \n This creates a false horizon - an observer sees objects that would not normally be seen. \n The area between the actual horizon and the false horizon may appear hazy. \n A dangerous object is in such a position that it is between the false \n and actual horizon, making it virtually invisible to the oncoming ship.
