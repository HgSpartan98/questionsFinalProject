# Final Project
# Aeowyn Kendall and Daniel Kim

# We need to build a program which will give the user a choice between
# two quizzes then call questions from a txt file, ask for user input, and
# check the input for certain keywords, and output different text if the
# keywords match

# This code provides intro text

               "question incorrectly, you will not be able to go back, " +
               "but must proceed to the next question.")
