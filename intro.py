# Final Project
# Aeowyn Kendall and Daniel Kim

# We need to build a program which will give the user a choice between
# two quizzes then call questions from a txt file, ask for user input, and
# check the input for certain keywords, and output different text if the
# keywords match

# This code provides intro text

    print("The following examination is designed to test the memory of a",
          "previously incapacitated individual. If you answer a question",
          "incorrectly, you will not be able to go back, but must proceed",
          "to the next question.")
